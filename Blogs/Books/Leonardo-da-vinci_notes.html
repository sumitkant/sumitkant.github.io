                <p class='noteText'>Much of what we know about Leonardo da Vinci today is thanks to a little - known artist who lived in the middle of the sixteenth century, Giorgio Vasari.

                <p class='noteText'>Leonardo suffered from his own information overload — but in a good way. Because he took what he knew and always improved on it, his genius set a standard that many today still grapple with. </p>
                <p>
                    The only problem there could possibly be with Leonardo da Vinci is that most of his original work was never finished or has been lost to time. Because he worked on so much at once, he rarely completed his projects.</p>
